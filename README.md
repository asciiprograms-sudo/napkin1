We've all been there. You need to jot down a quick password, sketch out a complex idea, or do some messy brainstorming, but you don't want it clogging up your pristine notes app or sitting in a "temp.txt" file forever. Enter **Napkin**. It's a simple, throw-away space for your digital scribbles. When you close it, everything disappears. No saves, no logs, no history. Just peace of mind.

## ✨ What's the Point?

-   🚫 **It Doesn't Save. Like, At All.** The entire point. Close the window, and your note is gone for good. No "Are you sure?" dialogs.
-   🎨 **A Few Pleasant Themes.** Light, Dark, a cozy Sepia, and a calming Sea Blue. Because staring at a blank page should be enjoyable.
-   🆕 **One-Click Amnesia.** The "NEW" button isn't just for new notes; it's for a clean slate. Click it and forget what was there.
-   ⌨️ **Keyboard Friendly.** `Ctrl+D` to wipe the slate instantly. No mouse needed.
-   💾 **Zero Footprint.** The app doesn't create any files. It leaves no trace on your system. It's a ghost.
-   🎯 **It Stays Out of Your Way.** The interface is minimal by design. Your thoughts are the focus, not the UI.

## 🎮 How to Use It (It's Simple)

1.  **Open Napkin.**
2.  **Type stuff.** A password, an idea, a shopping list, a rant.
3.  **Change the theme** if the vibe isn't right (Click the 🎨 button).
4.  **Clear it** whenever you want (Click 🆕 NEW or hit `Ctrl+D`).
5.  **Close the window.** Consider your note evaporated.

## 🎨 The Themes

| Theme | Vibe Check |
| :--- | :--- |
| **☀️ Light** | Your standard, clean, and bright theme. Default for a reason. |
| **🌙 Dark** | Easy on the eyes, perfect for late-night thoughts. |
| **📜 Sepia** | Warm, yellowish tones. Feels like an old parchment or a coffee-stained napkin. |
| **🌊 Sea Blue** | A Totally Eye-Straining Theme, Do not use. this will be removed.. sometime. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

**The Quick Way (Clone and Go):**
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/asciiprogramers-sudo/napkin1.git

cargo run
```
## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + D` | **D**elete everything. Instant regret. |


## 🏗️ Building from Source

Want to build a release binary? Easy.

```bash
# Build it for real
cargo build --release

# Your executable will be waiting in ./target/release/napkin
# Drag it somewhere in your PATH and use it from anywhere!
```

## 🤔 But... Why Though?

I built Napkin because I was tired of:
-   Manually deleting "temp.txt" for the hundredth time.
-   Worrying about sensitive info sitting in my "Notes" app.
-   Cluttering my desktop with sticky notes.
-   Overthinking where to put a throw-away thought.
-   And the Government spying on my totally fake rants.

It's perfect for:
-   **Temporary Brain Dumps:** Ideas you just need to get out of your head.
-   **Sensitive Info:** Typing a password or API key you need to copy once.
-   **Quick Calculations:** Math you don't need a receipt for.
-   **Meeting Notes:** That vanish as soon as the meeting is over.
-   **Digital Doodles:** Because sometimes you just need to scribble. (with text.)

## 💝 Final Thoughts

This was a fun little one-day project to shake off some Rust. I hope you find it as useful as I do.

```rust
// Compiled with care and a slightly unhealthy amount of Paulaner Spezi
println!("Thanks for checking it out! <3");
```
(Note: This is [Spezi](https://www.edeka24.de/Paulaner-Spezi-0-5L.html).. by the way.)

**⚠️ Remember: This app is designed to forget.** Do not use it for anything you might want to keep(that app is called notepad or gedit if you´re on GNOME).
